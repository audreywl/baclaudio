# BACLaudio
BACLaudio is an auditory and visual experience generator. Taking in a variety of songs (we've chosen to theme this iteration on the Shrek soundtrack), BACLaudio generates a visualization of the lyrical and instrumental sentiment. In the form of a series of dots and functions, the continuously running patterns depict the instrumental sentiment based on chords and beat. Meanwhile, the color of the dots is determined by the sentiment of the song lyrics as determined by language processing.
