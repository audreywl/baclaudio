# The Visualization 

## The Colors
The color key maps to the lyric sentiment.  A line that is completely positive will be red, and completely negative will be dark blue.  Any other ratio of positive to negative exists on our gradient scale.  Most of the colors that will be seen in a visualization of a song are a greenish-blue to orangish-red because it is rare that a line is only positive or only negative.  If there are no lyrics or the sentiment is not polar enough, the color is set to a default gray.
